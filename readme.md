# How to Run this App
  * Clone repository.
  * Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
  * Run `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`.
  * Run `npm test` or `yarn test`.
  * Serve `index.html` using `live-server` or similar.

# Requirements
We need `node` & `npm`, as well as packages `live-server` and `eslint` installed _globally_. VSCode's `eslint` extension is recommended. Command line commands are run inside the project folder. This guide uses npm but should work the same using yarn.

# Objectives
  * Deeper dive into React Router.
  * Learn about the render prop for inlining functions inside `Route`.

  * Learn about `history.replace()`.
  * Learn about the `NavLink` component.
  * Learn about the `Redirect` component.
  * Creating `Links` using `match.url`.
  * Creating sub-routes.
